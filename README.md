# Procura - Procurement Management System

## Procurement/Accounting Staff
These users are the source of the pricing and product information for the application and need to have access to details of the raised purchase orders and delivery advice information.

## Management
These stakeholders are less obvious than the others. However, they consume all the  information produced by the system as well as setting out all the policies and      procedures that relate to these activities and by which the other stakeholders are  obligated to adhere to.

### The Procurement Process
There are number of key stages to any procurement as outlined below:

#### Requisition
This is the process by which an authorized employee makes a request to purchase items on behalf of the organization. This can be limited to pre-approved suppliers, or to a restricted items catalogue, dependent upon the policies of the organization. A suitable account to take the funds for the purchase is typically identified at this stage too.

#### Approval
The purchase requisitions are now considered by a more senior member of staff (e.g. a supervisor, line manager, etc.). Some systems apply different approval hierarchies to this stage of the process. For example, employees may be able to purchase goods under a limit of Rs. 100,000 without requiring approval. Or, regardless of the overall value of the requisition, certain items may always require approval. Some organizations may instigate approval by multiple managers. These types of rules vary and are organization specific. The point is, however, that different organizations have different hierarchies and rules for the approval of requisitions.

#### Order
Once the requisition has been approved a purchase order is raised and sent to the Supplier to be fulfilled. This will normally contain a standard set of information, e.g.
• Company details
• Supplier details
• Delivery address details
• A unique purchase order reference
• The date by which the goods are required
• The quantity, description and agreed price of the items
The purchase order reference is used to track the purchase and the supplier is asked to quote this reference on all deliveries and documents that relate to this order.

#### Goods Receipt
At this stage the supplier delivers or supplies the goods, usually with a delivery advice note. This document should have the purchase order reference on it. The goods are checked upon receipt to ensure their condition and the quantity is correct with the delivery advice note. The person that takes delivery of the goods signs the delivery advice note as acceptance of receipt. The delivery is then compared against the purchase order to ensure that the required goods have been received. There can be multiple deliveries to make up the total quantities requested on a purchase order, so it is important that as each delivery arrives, the goods are checked and matched against the lines of the purchase order.
